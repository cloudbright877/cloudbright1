          title: "What Are Cookies",
          content: `This Cookie Policy explains how Celestian Limited uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our AI-powered cryptocurrency trading platform. This policy should be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy, which provides additional information about how we collect, use, and protect your personal data.

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer, smartphone, or other device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, provide a better user experience, and provide information to the website owners. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your device's hard drive and can be used to identify your browser, remember your preferences, and track your activities on the website.

There are different types of cookies based on their lifespan and origin. Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period or until you manually delete them. First-party cookies are set by the website you're visiting (in this case, Celestian), while third-party cookies are set by domains other than the one you're visiting, typically by partners or service providers we work with.

Similar technologies include web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs), which are small graphic images embedded in web pages or emails that work together with cookies to track user behavior, local storage objects (sometimes called "Flash cookies"), and device fingerprinting techniques that collect information about your device configuration to create a unique identifier for your device.`

          title: "Types of Cookies We Use",
          content: `Celestian uses various types of cookies to provide, secure, and improve our platform and services. Each type of cookie serves a specific purpose and helps us deliver a better user experience while ensuring the security and functionality of our cryptocurrency trading platform.

We categorize our cookies into several distinct types based on their function: Essential Cookies, which are necessary for the platform to operate; Performance and Analytics Cookies, which help us understand how users interact with our platform; Functionality Cookies, which enable enhanced features and personalization; and Marketing Cookies, which are used to deliver relevant advertisements and measure campaign effectiveness.

The cookies we use range from session cookies that are deleted when you close your browser to persistent cookies that may remain on your device for extended periods. The duration of persistent cookies varies depending on their purpose, but we limit cookie lifespans to what is necessary for their intended function and in compliance with applicable privacy regulations.

Some cookies are set by Celestian directly (first-party cookies), while others are set by our trusted partners and service providers (third-party cookies). We carefully vet all third-party cookie providers to ensure they meet our privacy and security standards and comply with applicable data protection laws. All cookies we use are described in detail in the following sections of this policy.`

        {
          title: "Essential Cookies",
          content: `Essential cookies are strictly necessary for our platform to function properly and cannot be disabled in our systems without significantly impacting your ability to use our services. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary for their specific technical function, and they are exempt from consent requirements under most privacy regulations because they are essential to provide services you have requested.

Authentication cookies are crucial for maintaining your logged-in state across different pages of our platform. When you log in to your Celestian account, we set a secure authentication cookie that allows our servers to recognize you as you navigate through different sections of the platform without requiring you to log in repeatedly. These cookies typically expire after a set period of inactivity or when you explicitly log out.

Security cookies help protect your account and our platform from fraudulent activity, unauthorized access attempts, and security threats. These cookies enable us to detect suspicious login patterns, verify the integrity of your session, prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, and maintain security features such as two-factor authentication. They also help us comply with regulatory requirements for securing financial platforms.

Load balancing cookies ensure that your requests are routed to the appropriate server in our infrastructure, maintaining session consistency and optimal platform performance. Payment processing cookies are essential for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions and ensuring that your trades are executed properly. Cookie consent cookies remember your cookie preferences so we don't repeatedly ask you to make the same choices each time you visit our platform.`

          title: "Analytics Cookies",
          content: `Analytics cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our platform by collecting and reporting information anonymously or in aggregate form. These cookies enable us to analyze user behavior, identify trends, measure the effectiveness of our features, and make data-driven decisions to improve our services. We use analytics data to enhance user experience, optimize platform performance, and develop new features that meet our users' needs.

We primarily use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC, to track and analyze platform usage. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as which pages you visit, how long you spend on each page, how you arrived at our platform, what you click on, and technical information about your device and browser. This information is transmitted to Google's servers and processed to generate statistical reports about platform activity.

The analytics cookies we use track various metrics including page views, unique visitors, session duration, bounce rates, conversion rates, traffic sources, user demographics (age range and general location), device types, browser types, and user flow through the platform. We also use analytics to understand which AI trading features are most popular, how users configure their trading parameters, and where users encounter difficulties or errors.

We implement IP anonymization in Google Analytics, which means that your full IP address is not stored, and we have configured our analytics tools to respect "Do Not Track" signals where technically feasible. The data collected through analytics cookies is typically retained for 26 months unless we have a legitimate reason to retain it longer, and we regularly review our analytics data retention practices to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.`

          title: "Marketing Cookies",
          content: `Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across websites and deliver advertisements that are relevant and engaging to individual users, making them more valuable for publishers and third-party advertisers. These cookies help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, understand which marketing channels bring users to our platform, and retarget users who have shown interest in our services.

We use marketing cookies to display Celestian advertisements on third-party websites and platforms you may visit after leaving our platform. This practice, known as retargeting or remarketing, allows us to remind you about our services and show you relevant content based on your previous interactions with our platform. For example, if you started the account registration process but didn't complete it, we might show you an advertisement encouraging you to complete your registration.

These cookies also help us attribute conversions to specific marketing campaigns, understand which advertising messages resonate with our audience, and optimize our advertising spend by focusing on the most effective channels. We may use cookies from advertising platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag, and other advertising networks that comply with industry privacy standards.

Marketing cookies typically track information such as which advertisements you've seen, which ones you've clicked on, whether you've visited our platform after seeing an ad, your general interests based on websites you visit, and demographic information when available. We limit the use of marketing cookies to what is necessary for our legitimate business interests and in compliance with applicable privacy laws, including obtaining consent where required by law.`

          title: "Third-Party Cookies",
          content: `In addition to cookies set by Celestian directly, our platform may include cookies set by third-party service providers and partners who help us deliver and improve our services. These third parties may use cookies to provide their services, collect information about your online activities, and deliver relevant content or advertisements. We carefully select our third-party partners and require them to comply with applicable privacy laws and our data protection standards.

Our third-party cookies come from several categories of service providers: (a) Analytics providers such as Google Analytics, which help us understand platform usage and user behavior; (b) Payment processors and cryptocurrency exchange integrations that facilitate transactions on our platform; (c) Customer support tools like live chat services that help us provide assistance; (d) Fraud prevention and security services that protect against unauthorized access and malicious activity; (e) Content delivery networks (CDNs) that optimize platform performance and speed; and (f) Social media platforms that enable sharing features and social login options.

When you interact with social media features on our platform, such as "Share" buttons or social login options, the social media platform may set cookies on your device. These cookies are controlled by the respective social media companies and are subject to their own privacy policies and cookie policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms you interact with.

Third-party advertising networks may also set cookies to deliver targeted advertisements based on your interests. These networks track your browsing behavior across multiple websites to build interest profiles and show you relevant ads. We do not control these third-party cookies and are not responsible for their privacy practices. However, you can opt out of interest-based advertising through industry opt-out mechanisms described in the "Managing Cookies" section of this policy.`

          title: "Managing Cookies",
          content: `You have several options for managing and controlling cookies on our platform and in your browser. While we recommend accepting cookies to ensure full functionality of our platform, we respect your right to manage your cookie preferences according to your privacy preferences and applicable law.

Most modern web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. You can set your browser to refuse all cookies, accept only first-party cookies, or prompt you before accepting any cookie. Browser-based cookie controls typically include options to: view and delete existing cookies, block all cookies, block third-party cookies while allowing first-party cookies, block cookies from specific websites, or clear all cookies when you close your browser.

To manage cookies in specific browsers: In Chrome, go to Settings > Privacy and security > Cookies and other site data; in Firefox, go to Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data; in Safari, go to Preferences > Privacy > Cookies and website data; in Edge, go to Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Cookies and site data. Mobile browsers typically offer similar controls in their settings menus.

For third-party advertising cookies, you can opt out of interest-based advertising through industry opt-out platforms such as the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out page at optout.networkadvertising.org, the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) opt-out page at optout.aboutads.info, or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt-out page at youronlinechoices.eu. These platforms allow you to opt out of cookies from multiple advertising networks at once.

Please note that blocking or deleting cookies may impact your ability to use certain features of our platform. Essential cookies cannot be disabled through our cookie consent tool as they are necessary for the platform to function, but you can still block them through your browser settings, though this will prevent you from using our services effectively.`

          title: "Cookie Consent",
          content: `Celestian is committed to transparency about our use of cookies and respecting your choices regarding cookie consent. When you first visit our platform, if you are located in a jurisdiction that requires cookie consent (such as the European Union, United Kingdom, or other regions with similar privacy laws), you will be presented with a cookie consent banner that explains our use of cookies and asks for your consent before non-essential cookies are set on your device.

Our cookie consent mechanism allows you to make granular choices about which categories of cookies you wish to accept. You can choose to accept all cookies, reject non-essential cookies, or customize your preferences by category. The categories typically include: Essential Cookies (which cannot be disabled as they are necessary for the platform to function), Performance and Analytics Cookies, Functionality Cookies, and Marketing and Advertising Cookies.

Your cookie preferences are stored in a cookie consent preference cookie (which is itself an essential cookie), so we remember your choices on future visits and don't repeatedly ask you to make the same decision. You can change your cookie preferences at any time by accessing the cookie settings through the link in our website footer, through your account settings, or by clearing your cookies and revisiting the platform, which will trigger the consent banner again.

We respect your cookie choices and will only set non-essential cookies for which you have provided consent. If you decline certain categories of cookies, some features of our platform may not function optimally, but you will still be able to access the core trading functionality. We implement cookie consent in compliance with the EU ePrivacy Directive, GDPR, UK Data Protection Act, and other applicable privacy regulations.`
