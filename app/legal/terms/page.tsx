          content: `Trading cryptocurrencies and digital assets involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. You acknowledge and agree that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and that the value of digital assets can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. You may lose some or all of your invested capital.

The AI-powered trading features provided by Celestian are tools designed to assist with trading decisions, but they do not guarantee profits or protect against losses. Past performance of our AI models or trading algorithms is not indicative of future results. Market conditions can change rapidly, and historical data may not accurately predict future market behavior.

You acknowledge that trading decisions made using our platform, whether manual or AI-assisted, are your sole responsibility. Celestian does not provide investment advice, and nothing on our platform should be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular cryptocurrency or digital asset. You should conduct your own research and consult with qualified financial advisors before making any trading decisions.

You understand that technical issues, including but not limited to platform outages, connectivity problems, or software errors, may prevent you from executing trades or managing your positions. Celestian shall not be liable for any losses resulting from such technical issues, except to the extent required by applicable law. We recommend that you never invest more than you can afford to lose.`

This limitation applies to all causes of action in the aggregate, including without limitation breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligence, strict liability, misrepresentation, and other torts.

The platform and all content are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. Celestian does not warrant that the platform will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or that defects will be corrected.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the limitations set forth above may not apply to you. If you are dissatisfied with any portion of the platform or with these Terms, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of the platform.`

You may terminate your account at any time by following the account closure procedures provided on the platform or by contacting our support team. Upon voluntary termination, you remain responsible for all charges incurred prior to termination, and certain provisions of these Terms will survive termination, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, limitation of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution provisions.

Termination of your account does not relieve you of any obligations incurred prior to termination, nor does it relieve Celestian of any obligations that by their nature should survive termination. All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including without limitation ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.`

          title: "Governing Law",

You agree that any legal action or proceeding between you and Celestian for any purpose concerning these Terms or the parties' obligations hereunder shall be brought exclusively in the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting in the jurisdiction of Celestian Limited's incorporation. You hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such courts.

Nothing in these Terms shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you. If you are a consumer in the European Union, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident. Nothing in these Terms affects your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.

In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any applicable local consumer protection laws, the provisions which provide greater protection to consumers shall prevail to the extent of such conflict. Any clause declared invalid shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.`
